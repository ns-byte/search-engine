Efficient XML Document Retrieval System Using Boolean, Proximity, and Ranked Query Search

This repository contains a Python-based document retrieval system that processes XML files, builds an inverted index, and performs Boolean, phrase, and proximity searches on documents. It supports stop word removal, stemming, and TF-IDF ranking for ranked queries. This project is ideal for those exploring information retrieval methods or constructing search engines with complex query processing capabilities.
